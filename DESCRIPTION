Description: Statistical power and minimum required sample size calculations for  (1) testing a proportion (one-sample) against a constant,  (2) testing a mean (one-sample) against a constant,  (3) testing difference between two proportions (independent samples),  (4) testing difference between two means (independent and paired samples),  (5) testing a correlation (one-sample) against a constant,  (6) testing difference between two correlations (independent samples), (7) testing a coefficient against a constant in multiple linear regression, (8) testing an indirect effect in the mediation analysis (Sobel, Joint, and Monte Carlo), (9) testing an R-squared against zero in linear regression, (10) testing an R-squared difference against zero in hierarchical regression,  (11) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for main and interaction effects) against zero in analysis of variance (could be one-way, two-way, and three-way),  (12) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for main and interaction effects) against zero in analysis of covariance (could be one-way, two-way, and three-way),  (13) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for between, within, and interaction effects) against zero in one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (with non-sphericity correction and repeated measures correlation). Alternative hypothesis can be formulated as "not equal", "less", "greater", "non-inferior", "superior", or "equivalent" in (1), (2), (3), and (4); as "not equal", "less", or "greater" in (5) and (6); but always as "greater" in (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11).
